# App Website Template
This was created as my final project for CIS255 at Saginaw Valley State University. I am releasing it as free & openfor everyone to use. The weather _widget_ at the bottom automatically gets the users location and can be removed if desired. Also includes a working php form, however you do need php on the server you are hosting it on.

See the license for more more info.
